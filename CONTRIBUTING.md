If you are contributing for the **first time**:

* Fork this repo to your Github account
* Clone your version on your account down to your machine from your account, e.g,. `git clone https://github.com/<yourgithubusername>/R-micromap-package-development.git`
* All changes and pull requests should be made on the development branch. Setup tracking for the remote development branch on your account with `git branch development origin/development`.
* Progress upstream should also be tracked (i.e., on our version of `R-micromap-package-development` at `USEPA/R-micromap-package-development`) by doing `git remote add upstream https://github.com/USEPA/R-micromap-package-development.git`.
